  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      XML file generated by running 
      <a href="http://www.barnet.gov.uk/garden-and-kitchen-waste-collection-streets.pdf">http://www.barnet.gov.uk/garden-and-kitchen-waste-collection-streets.pdf</a>
      through
      <tt>"pdftohtml&nbsp;-xml"</tt>
    </li>
    <li>
      a comma-separated file with this format:
      <div style="font-family:monospace;padding:1em 1em 1em 2em;">
          initial lines are ignored until this one is found: <br/>

      Once you've uploaded the file(s), apply the <b>Import data from file</b> action to it to import the data.
  </p>
  <p>
      The file is deleted once the import has been completed.
