Tests
=====

Valid postcodes redirect to page for appropriate street
Page for appropriate street shows when bin is collected there

When cobrand set to Barnet:
    * looks like Barnet site
    * only Barnet postcodes allowed


Give an option of two times (9am, 6pm)

Improvements
============

For green waste, Athenaeum Road is "Tuesday/Thursday". Deal better with that. (There are 16 examples)

Different blocks of flats on one street can have different days.
