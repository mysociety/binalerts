Improvements
============

Change "query" to say something nicer

For green waste, Athenaeum Road is "Tuesday/Thursday". Deal better with that. (There are 16 examples)

Different blocks of flats on one street can have different days.

Some kind of tri-based fuzzy matching

Store date that data was valid for (last updated)


Administrivia
=============

Factor out street into its own model, separate from collection?

Validate some HTML

Get ./manage.py test to work for auth app, which it doesn't

Change url_name to be a SlugField
Make sure unique keys on url_name
