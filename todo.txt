Tests
=====

Make it go at a particular time of day more precisely (currently just relies on cron)
Give an option of two times for alerts (9am, 6pm) (Maybe)

Ajaxify

Unsubscribe

Cope gracefully with same data being loaded twice (not sure what it should do or what
it does at the moment)


Improvements
============

For green waste, Athenaeum Road is "Tuesday/Thursday". Deal better with that. (There are 16 examples)

Different blocks of flats on one street can have different days.

Some kind of tri-based fuzzy matching

Store date that data was valid for (last updated)


Administrivia
=============

Make sure unique keys on url_name

Factor out street into its own model, separate from collection?

Validate some HTML

Get ./manage.py test to work for auth app, which it doesn't
(it only works for binalerts)
