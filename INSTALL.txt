Bin Alerts - how to get it running
==========

It's a normal Django application. You can find the heart of things in
pylib/djangoproj.

It's using South, so you need to run both syncdb and migrate to set up the
databases.
    ./manage.py syncdb
    ./manage.py migrate

You can load collection time data in with one of these, a small sample used by
the test code, or a large full file:
    ./manage.py loadpdf garden_sample_pdf.xml
    ./manage.py garden-and-kitchen-waste-collection-streets.xml

For me only the binalerts app tests work (not the Django core ones). So I run
tests like this:
    ./manage.py test binalerts

It's being made with test driven development. So please add tests first, or if
you really can't discipline yourself, add them afterwards :)
